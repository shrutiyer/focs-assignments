## I. (Undirected) Graphs

A **graph** is a set of points (called **nodes** or **vertices**), connected pair-wise by lines (called **edges**).

Formally, a graph is an ordered pair *G* = (*V*, *E*): *V* is a set of vertices; E is a set of edges; and an edge is a set of the nodes that are its ends.

*Example*:

*G* = ({1, 2, 3}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}})

### 1. Match the diagrams to the graph structures.

![](images/graphs.svg)

(i) *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {{1, 2}, {1, 4}, {3, 4}})

(ii) *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {{1, 2}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}})

(iii) *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 5}})

(iv) *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {{1, 2}, {1, 4}, {1, 3}})

### 2. Cycles

Two vertices are **adjacent** if there's an edge between them.

A **cycle** is a sequence of adjacent vertices that begin and end with the same vertex.

Which of (1a-d) contains a cycle? For those graphs that contain a cycle, what is the cycle?

### 3. Draw a diagram for this graph.

*G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {1, 5}})









### 4. Write the graph (V, E) for this diagram.

This is a single graph. It is not a **connected graph**.

*G* =

## II. Directed Graphs

A **directed graph** (“digraph”) is a set of vertices, together with arrows that begin and end on a vertex.

Formally, *G* = (*V*, *A*), where *A* is a set of tuples $(V_i, V_j)$.

### 5. Match the diagrams to the graphs.

![](images/digraphs.svg)

(i) *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4)})

(ii) *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (1, 4), (4, 3)})

(iii) *G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (4, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4)})

### 6. Directed acyclic graphs

A cycle in a directed graph is a sequence of vertices, that starts and ends with the same vertex, where for each pair of consecutive vertices in the sequence there's an arrow from the first to the second.

A **directed acycle graph** (DAG) is a digraph that doesn't contain cycles.

Which of (5a-c) are DAGs?

### 7. Draw a diagram for this graph.











*G* = ({1, 2, 3, 4}, {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (1, 3)})

Is this graph a DAG?

### 6. Write the graph (V, A) for this diagram.

### 7. Adjacency matrices 

An **adjacency matrix** is a square matrix *A* such that $A_{i,j}$ = 1 iff there is an arrow from vertex *i* to vertex *j*.

Write the adjacency matrix for the graph in (5a).
