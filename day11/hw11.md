```

## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

1. _p -> q_     (Given)
2. _p -> r_     (Given)
3. _p_          (Assumption)
4. _q_          (1, 3, Modus Ponens)
5. _r_          (2, 3, Modus Ponens)
6. _q AND r_    (4, 5, Conjunction)
7. Therefore _p -> (q AND r)_

### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_

1. _p -> (q OR r)_              (Given)
2. _p -> (q OR NOT r)_          (Given)
3. _p_                          (Assumption)
4. _q OR r_                     (1, 3, Modus Ponens)
5. _q OR NOT r_                 (2, 3, Modus Ponens)
6. _NOT (r AND NOT r)_          (4, 5, Negation, DOuble Negative)
7. _q_                          (4, 5, 6)
8. Therefore _p -> q_

## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]

 _p_ | _q_ | _r_ | _p -> q_ | _p -> r_ | _(q AND r)_ | _p -> (q AND r)_ 
-----|-----|-----|----------|----------|-------------|-------------------
  0  |  0  | 0   |    1     |    1     |     0       |      1
  0  |  0  | 1   |    1     |    1     |     0       |      1
  0  |  1  | 0   |    1     |    1     |     0       |      1
  0  |  1  | 1   |    1     |    1     |     1       |      1
  1  |  0  | 0   |    0     |    0     |     0       |      0
  1  |  0  | 1   |    0     |    1     |     0       |      0    
  1  |  1  | 0   |    1     |    0     |     0       |      0
  1  |  1  | 1   |    1     |    1     |     1       |      1

## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_

Tautology and satisfiable

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_

Tautology and satisfiable

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_

| p | q | p -> q | (p -> q) -> p |
|:-:|:-:|:------:|:-------------:|
| 0 | 0 |    1   |       0       |
| 0 | 1 |    1   |       0       |
| 1 | 0 |    0   |       1       |
| 1 | 1 |    1   |       1       |

Not tautology and satisfiable

### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 

Not true for `p=1 q=0 r=0` and `p=1 q=1 r=0`

Not a tautology and satisfiable

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_

## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))_

**Ans.**

Simplifying the implication,

p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (**(NOT s) OR t**)))

Using DeMorgan's

p OR (q AND (NOT r OR NOT ((NOT s) OR t)))

Using DeMorgan's

p OR (q AND (NOT r OR (s AND NOT t)))

Using Distributive,

p OR (q AND ((NOT r OR s) AND (NOT r OR NOT t)))

Using Distributive,

p OR ((q AND (NOT r OR s)) AND (q AND (NOT r OR NOT t)))

Using Distributive,

(p OR (q AND (NOT r OR s)) AND (p OR (q AND (NOT r OR NOT t)))

Using Distributive,

(p OR q) AND (p OR (NOT r OR s)) AND (p OR q) AND (p OR (NOT r OR NOT t)))

Using Distributive,

(p OR q) AND (p OR NOT r OR s) AND (p OR q) AND (p OR NOT r OR NOT t))

## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

For the cases that p is TRUE, the formula is TRUE as well. It is because all the `OR` cases have p in them and will turn TRUE. Then, those TRUE statements get `AND`ed. Used short certificate.
