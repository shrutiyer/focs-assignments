# FOCS Day 11 In Class

## I. Truth Tables

### 1. AND

Fill in the truth table for _a AND b_

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ AND _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | 
 F  |  T  | 
 T  |  F  | 
 T  |  T  | 

This truth table is written with the rows in *canonical order*.  Do you know why this order is canonical (i.e. standard)?  [Hint:  If you represent `false` as 0 and `true` as 1, in what order are these rows?]





### 2. Lots of NOTs

Now complete the truth table for _NOT ((NOT a) AND (NOT b))_

_a_ | _b_ | _NOT a_ | _NOT b_ | _(NOT a) AND (NOT b)_ | _NOT ((NOT a) AND (NOT b))_
----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---
 F  |  F  |     |     |     |     
 F  |  T  |     |     |     |     
 T  |  F  |     |     |     |     
 T  |  T  |     |     |     |     

Do you recognize this function by another name?





### 3. Not here or there

Build the truth table for _(NOT a) OR b_.  [_OR_ is true if *at least*` one of its arguments is true.]

_a_ | _b_ | _NOT a_ | _(NOT a) OR b_ 
----|-----|-----|---
 F  |  F  |     |   
 F  |  T  |     |   
 T  |  F  |     |   
 T  |  T  |     |   



### 4. Six of one, half a dozen of the other

Finally, build a truth table for _(a AND (NOT b)) OR (b AND (NOT a))_

_a_ | _b_ | _NOT a_ | _NOT b_ | _a AND (NOT b)_ | _b AND (NOT a)_ | _(a AND (NOT b)) OR (b AND (NOT a))_
----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---
 F  |  F  |     |     |     |     |     
 F  |  T  |     |     |     |     |     
 T  |  F  |     |     |     |     |     
 T  |  T  |     |     |     |     |     

Can you write another expression with the same truth values as _(a AND (NOT b)) OR (b AND (NOT a))_?  (Can you write more than one?)




## II. Knights and Knaves 

Knights always tell the truth; knaves always lie.  Everyone on a particular island is either a knight or a knave.

These problems are adapted from that most Normal of Sorcerers, Raymond Smullyan, *What is the Name of this Book?*, Chapter 3.

### 1. An old problem

A stranger on the island encounters three inhabitants -- A, B, and C -- and asks A, "Are you a knight or a knave?"  A's answer is not intelligible.  The stranger asks B, "What did A say?"  B answers, "A said that he is a knave."  C interrupts, saying "Don't believe B; he is lying."

What are B and C?



### 2. Smullyan's improvement

In the previous problem, Smullyan notes that C is irrelevant.  His proposed revision:
A's answer is still intelligible.  B says "A says there is one knight among us."  C interrupts, saying "Don't believe B; he is lying."

Now what are B and C?



### 3. At least one...

Suppose there are two inhabitants, A and B.  A says "At least one of us is a knave."  What are A and B?  



### 4. Or else...

Suppose A says instead, "Either I am a knave or B is a knight."  Now what are A and B?



### 5. Knight after knight

Three inhabitants are present.  A says, "All of us are knights."  B says, "Exactly one of us is a knight."  What are A, B, and C?



### 6. Knight's end

Suppose instead, A says, "All of us are knaves" and B says, "Exactly one of us is a knight."  Can you tell what B is?  What C is?



### 7. Not me!

If A says, "I am a knave, but B isn't", what are A and B?



### 8. Same as another

A says, "B is a knave."  B says, "A and C are of the same type."  What is C?



### 9. Mind reading

A says, "B and C are of the same type."  If someone asks C, "Are A and B of the same type?" what does C answer?



### 10. Smullyan's adventure

Once when Smullyan was on the island, he encountered two inhabitants.  He asked one, "Is either of you a knight?"  When the inhabitant responded, Smullyan knew the answer to his question.  What is each of the two inhabitants?  Smullyan promises there's plenty of information here to solve the problem.




## III. Proofs

### 1. Use truth tables to prove De Morgan's Laws













### 2. Use rules of inference to prove the following:

Assume:  
_(NOT p) -> (q AND r)_
_p -> s_
_NOT s_

Prove:  _q_







### 3. Use rules of inference to prove the following:

Assume:  
_p AND q_
_p -> NOT (q AND r)_
_s -> r_

Prove:  _NOT s_





### 4. Use rules of inference to prove the following:

Assume:  
_(NOT (p OR q)) -> r_
_NOT p_
_NOT r_

Prove:  _q_




### 5. Replicate any of the proofs in 2, 3, or 4 using truth tables.
