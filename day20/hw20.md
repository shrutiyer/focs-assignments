## 1. Datalog

a. Consider a dialect of Datalog that includes `not`. [Many implementations include `not`. Racket Catalog does not.] What is value of the query in the following program?

```
likes(amy, susan).
likes(susan, amy).
likes(mark, amy).
unliked(X) :- not likes(Someone, X).
unliked(mark)?
```

b. How about after extending this program with the following fact?

```
likes(amy, mark).
unliked(mark)?
```

c. Is Datalog NP-Complete?

## 2. SQL

Read about SQL **joins**: inner join, left (outer) join, right (outer) join, and full (outer) join. Here are some explanations of joins:

* [What Is a SQL Join](http://www.sql-join.com) and [Basic SQL Join Types](http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types) – Stitch Co.
* [A Visual Explanation of SQL Joins](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/) – Jeff Atwood

Consider the tables `college` and `town`:

| college_name | students | town_name |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| Babson       | 2840     | Needham   |
| Olin         | 350      | Needham   |
| Wellesley    | 2474     | Wellesley |

| town_name | population | settled_date |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Needham   | 28,888     | 1680         |
| Dedham    | 24,729     | 1635         |

What values does each of the following joins select?

 All joins are on the column `town_name` that is present in both tables. (That is, these are **natural joins**.) 

a. An inner join of `college` and `town`.

b. A left join of `college` and `town`.

c. A right join of `college` and `town`.

d. A full join of `college` and `town`.


## 3. Prolog

Do chapter 1 of [Learn Prolog Now](http://lpn.swi-prolog.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=online). Note that this is the version with embedded exercises, which is not what a generic search turns up.

You do not have to turn in the exercises in 1.3 (or any others), but those are a good gauge of your understanding.

You are also welcome to download and install [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org) or [gprolog](http://www.gprolog.org), but these are not required.

## 4. (Optional) Sorting

Using the descriptions of sorting algorithms in the PDF attached to [Day 15](https://sites.google.com/site/focs16fall/in-class-exercises/day-15-sorting-and-friends):

Write out the steps in sorting the following arrays with each of the algorithms.  Specifically, show the state of the array after each pass through the outer loop.  [NB:  you may omit passes that either subdivide or concatenate sub-arrays without changing the order.]

`3 9 4 1 8 3 7 2`


`3 1 2 4 6 5 2 7`


`9 1 8 2 7 6 5 4`


`8 3 4 3 4 8 3 4`
