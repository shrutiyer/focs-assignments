# FOCS Day 2 Assignment

### Setup

Follow the instructions in [Set Up Your Environment](https://sites.google.com/site/focs16fall/assignments/set-up-your-environment):
fork the [focs-assignments](https://github.com/focs16fall/focs-assignments) repository to your GitHub account; and download its files to your disk.

### Reading

Read [Scheme in One Page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dwpjm6mvxbSf_8WAwhHRqo8ZUWuc9MXBU7cR-hnMZMc/edit?usp=sharing).

Find the [focs-assignments/day2](https://github.com/focs16fall/focs-assignments/tree/master/day2) subdirectory.
It contains these files:

* `calc_idiomatic.py` – Python implementations of the calculator assignment that you did on Day 1

* `calc_schemey.py` – additional, bizarre Python implementations of the calculator assignment. These are not written the way a sane Python programmer would typically code them, but:

* `calc_scheme.rkt` – Racket (Scheme) implementations of the “schemey” Python implementations.

Review these files. Try to understand how the Python and Scheme implementations relate.

### Writing

Complete the definitions in [focs-assignments/day2/hw1.rkt](./hw1.rkt).

When you are done, follow the instructions in the [focs-assignments README](/README.md) to submit the assignment.

This assignment is due at noon on the day of class (September 8).
