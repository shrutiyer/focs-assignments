;;; Day 3 in class work

;;;;;;;;;;
;; 0.  Implement factorial both recursively and tail recursively.
;;     Hint:  The tail recursive version will use a helper function.


;;;;;;;;;;;
;; 1.  Filter is built in to scheme.

;; (filter even? '(1 2 3 4 5 6))  --> '(2 4 6)  ;; using the built-in even?
;; (filter teen? '(21 17 2 13 4 42 2 16 3)) --> '(17 13 16)
                        ;; assuming (define (teen x) (and (<= 13 x) (<= x 19)))))
;; (filter list? '(3 (3 2 1) symbol (4 2) (1 (2) 3)) --> '((3 2 1) (4 2) (1 (2) 3))

;; Implement it anyway.  You might want to call it my-filter?  What arguments does it take?





;;;;;;;;;;;
;; 2.  Map is also built in to scheme.

;; (map double '(1 2 3))  --> '(4 5 6)  ;; assuming (define (double x) (* 2 x))
;; (map incr '(1 2 3)) --> '(2 3 4)     ;; assuming (define (incr x) (+ x 1))
;; (map last '((3 2 1) (4 2) (1 2 3)) --> '(1 2 3)
                                        ;; assuming (define (last lst)
                                        ;;            (if (null? (rest lst))
                                        ;;                (first lst)
                                        ;;                (last (rest lst))))

;; Implement it as well.  You might want to call it my-map.  What arguments does it take?







;;;;;;;;;;;
;; 3.  While we're reimplementing built-ins, implement my-append (just like built in append)
;;     It takes two lists and returns a list containing all of the elements of the originals, in order.
;;     Note that it is purely functional, i.e., it doesn't MODIFY either of the lists that it is passed.

;; (append '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6)) --> '(1 2 3 4 5 6)

;; You might want to draw out the box and pointer structures for the original two lists
;; as well as for the new list.  Confirm with a member of the instructional staff....





;;;;;;;;;;;
;; 4.  zip takes two lists, and returns a list of elements of size two, until one of the lists runs out.

;; (zip '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6)) ;; --> '((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))
;; (zip '(1 2 3) '(a b c d e f g)) ;; --> '((1 a) (2 b) (3 c))

;; Implement `zip`.




;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; 5.  Last built-in (for now):  (my-)reverse.
;;     Takes a list, returns a new list with the elements reversed.

;; (reverse '(1 2 3)) --> '(3 2 1)



;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; More puzzles:
;;
;;  - (count elt lst) returns the number of times that elt appears in lst
;;  - (remove-dups lst) returns a new list that contains the elements of lst but without repeats
;;       (remove-dups '(1 2 3 1 4 5 2 4 6)) --> '(1 2 3 4 5 6)
;;  - reverse reverses a list, but doesn't reverse sublists in a tree.  (Try it and see.)
;;    Write deep-reverse, which reverses all sublists as well.
;;  - Which of these can you implement using tail recursion?
