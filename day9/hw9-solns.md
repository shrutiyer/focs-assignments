## 1. Reading

Read Sipser pp. 101–125. (This was the optional reading for today. It is required for Monday.)

## 2. Constructing Grammars

Construct a Context Free Grammar for each of the following languages.

a) All strings (over {0,1}) consisting of a substring _w_ followed by its reverse. (This is the same problem you were asked to work on in class.)

**Solution**:

	S -> 0S0
	S -> 1S1
	S -> ε

Equivalently:

	S -> 0S0 | 1S1 | ε


**Problem**:

Give a derivation for `010010`.

**Solution**:

	S -> 0S0 -> 01S10 -> 010ε010 = 010010

**Problem**:

b) All strings (over {a,b,c}) of the form a^{i}b^{i}c^{j}: an equal number of `a`s and `b`s, followed by any number of `c`s. For example, `aabb`, `aabbcc`, and `aabbcccc`, but not `aaaabbcc`.

**Solution**:

*G1*:

	S -> TU
	T -> aTb | ε
	U -> cU | ε

(The final rule could also be `U -> Uc | ε`.)

`T` derives any number of `a`s followed by an equal number of `c`s. `U` derives any number of `c`s.

Follow-on question: do *G2* or G3* work? (Are there strings that *G1* derives but *G2* or *G3* do not? Are there strings that *G2* or *G3* derive but *G1* does not?)

*G2*:

	S -> ST
	S -> aSb | ε
	T -> cT | ε

*G3*:

	S -> TS
	S -> Sc | ε
	T -> aTb | ε

**Problem**:

c) All strings (over {a,b,c}) of the form a^{i}b^{j}c^{j}: any number of `a`s, followed by an equal number of `b`s and `c`s. For example, `abbcc`, `aabbcc`, and `aaaabbcc`, but not `aabbccc`.

**Solution**:

	S -> TU
	T -> aT | ε
	U -> bUc | ε

**Problem**:

d) Give two distinct grammars that produce the strings described by the regular expression `(ab)*`: empty, `ab`, `abab`, `ababab`, ….

**Solution**:

Any two of:

*G1*:

	S -> abS | ε

*G2*:

	S -> Sab | ε

*G3*:

	S -> T
	T -> abT | ε

*G4*:

	S -> abT | ε
	T -> abT | ε

*G5*:

	S -> abT | ε
	T -> abS | ε

*G6*:

	S -> aT | ε
	T -> bS

(Would *G5* work if the final rule were `T -> bS | ε`?)

*G7*:

	S -> AU | ε
	T -> AU
	U -> BT
	A -> a
	B -> b

(*G7* is in Chomsky normal form.)

## 4. Ambiguous Grammars

Consider the grammar:

    S --> a S | a S b S | epsilon 

This grammar is ambiguous. Show in particular that the string `a a b` has
two:

a. parse trees

**Solution**:

**Problem**:

b. leftmost derivations (These are the ones that, starting from the start variable, rewrite the leftmost nonterminal first.)

**Solution**:

1.

	S -> a S        # using derivation S -> a S
	  -> a a S b S  # applying derivation S -> a S b S, to the (only) S
	  -> a a   b S  # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the leftmost S
	  -> a a   b    # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the remaining S

2.

	S -> a S   b S  # using derivation S -> a S b S
	  -> a a S b S  # applying derivation S -> a S, to the leftmost S
	  -> a a   b S  # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the leftmost S
	  -> a a   b    # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the remaining S

**Problem**:

c. rightmost derivations (These are the ones that, starting from the start variable, rewrite the rightmost nonterminal first.)

**Solution**:

1.

	S -> a S        # using derivation S -> a S
	  -> a a S b S  # applying derivation S -> a S b S, to the (only) S
	  -> a a S b    # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the rightmost S
	  -> a a   b    # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the remaining S

2.

	S -> a S   b S  # using derivation S -> a S b S
	  -> a S   b    # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the rightmost S
	  -> a a S b    # applying derivation S -> a S, to the rightmost S
	  -> a a   b    # applying derivation S -> epsilon, to the rightmost S

Extra Credit/Challenge: Prove that this grammar generates all and only the strings of `a`s and `b`s such that every prefix has at least as many `a`s as `b`s. **Hint: Do the readings!**


## 5. [Optional] Play with Prolog

Read the page and download the sample files from [here](https://sites.google.com/site/focs16fall/prolog).

Warning: your instructor was unable to get these to reliably run today, and some of the instructions are from memory of when it previously worked. Your mileage may vary.
