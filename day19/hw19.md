## 0. [Not a question] Terminology

In class on Monday, we drew [**call graphs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) of the `fib` function, with and without memoization.

This particular kind of call graph is a **dynamic call graph**, whose nodes are function *invocations* during the execution of a program. The nodes of a **static call graph** are function *names*; arrows indicate appearances of a call in the program source text.

A dynamic call graph of a *recursive* function is also called a **recursion graph**.

## 1. Predicate Calculus – Models

Consider Table 1:

| x    | y    |
| ---- | ---- |
| a    | b    |
| b    | c    |
| a    | c    |
| c    | d    |
| d    | c    |
| c    | c    |
| b    | a    |

*Table 1*: A model for `loves(x, y)`

a. For each of the following, is Table 1 a model?  Explain briefly why or why not.

1. ∃x. ∀y. loves(x, y)

   False. There is no such x that loves all y

2. ∃y. ∀x. loves(x, y)

   True. There are some y that are loved by all x. In the table, all (a, b, c, d) love c.

3. ∀x. ∃y. loves(x, y)

   True. Every value of x loves some value of y.

4. ∀y. ∃x. loves(x, y)

   True. All y are loved by some x.

5. ∃x. ∃y. loves(x, y)

   True. There are atleast an x that love some values of y.

6. ∃x. ∀y. ¬loves(x, y)

   True. There are some values of x that do not love all values of y

7. ∃x. ¬∀y. loves(x, y)

   True. There are some values of x that love not all values of y.

b. Consider three models: (i) objects are a, b, c, d; `loves` is Table 1; (ii) objects are integers; `loves(x, y) ` ≝ x ≧ y; (iii) `loves(x, y)` ≝ x = y. In which of these models are these statements true:

| Statement                                | Table 1 | x ≧ y | x = y |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| ∀x, x. loves(x, x)                       |  False  | True  | True  |
| ∀x, y. loves(x, y) → loves(y, x)         |  False  | False | True  |
| ∀x, y, z. loves(x, y) ∧ loves(y, z) → loves(x, z)| False | True | True |

c. (Optional) (Because we love graphs) Draw Table 1 as a digraph. What claims do each of the following make about a node x or y, in terms of its indegree and outdegree?

1. ∀x. loves(x, y)
2. ∀y. loves(x, y)
3. ∃x. loves(x, y)
4. ∃y. loves(x, y)

## 2. Predicate Calculus – Proofs

Given axioms:

1. ∀x. sum( x, 0, x )
2. ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( x, s(y), s(z) )
3. ∀x . product( x, 0, 0 )
4. ∀x, y, z, k. product( x, y, z ) ∧  sum( x, z, k ) → product( x, s(y), k )

Prove:

1.  ∃x. sum( x, x, s(s(0)) )

a) ∃x. x = s(0)

b) ∃x. sum(x, 0, s(0))          1, a

c) ∃x. sum(x, s(0), s(s(0))     2, b

d) ∃x. sum(x, x, s(s(0))        a, c

2.  ∀x. sum( 0, x, x ) [hint:  induction]

a) ∃x. x = 0

b) ∃x. sum(0, 0, 0)             1, a

c) ∃y. sum(0, y, y)             Inductive Hypothesis

d) ∀x. ∃y. x = s(y)             Inductive Step

e) ∃y. sum(0, s(y), s(y))       c

f) ∀x. ∃y. sum(0, x, x)         e

3.  [optional super-challenge] ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( y, x, z )

## 3. Maximum Subarray

The [maximum subarray problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) (*aka* maximum contiguous subsequence, *aka* maximum value contiguous subsequence) is “the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)).

```python
# Source: wikipedia 
def max_subarray(xs):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in xs:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
```

a. Draw a recursion graph of `max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.

This is not a recursive function as there is only one call to the function. The values of max_ending_here and max_so_far change as follows

| max_ending_here | max_so_far |
|:---------------:|:----------:|
|        0        |      0     |
|        0        |      0     |
|        1        |      1     |
|        0        |      1     |
|        4        |      4     |
|        3        |      4     |
|        5        |      5     |
|        6        |      6     |
|        1        |      6     |
|        5        |      6     |

b. Is `max_subarray` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not?

No, because the algorith doesn't divide the array into smaller chunks and calculate the sum and come together to calculate the sum again

c. Is `max_subarray` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not?

No. It constantly calculates the sum of a smaller subarray while updating the larger subarray's sum. But it doesn't store anything

d. Consider a *memoized* version of `max_subarray`. (You don't need to produce code for this. You do need to understand what memoization does to a call graph.) Draw the recursion graph for `memoized_max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.

This is not a recursive funtion and hence won't memoize something. If the function needs memoized, it will check if there exists a value for the given array.

e. [Optional challenge] Produce working code for memoized `max_subarray`.

## 4. Binary Search

```python
def binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, right):
    if left == right: return None
    middle = int((left + right) / 2)
    if x < xs[middle]:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, middle)
    elif xs[middle] < x:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, middle, right)
    else:
        return middle

def binary_search_array(x, xs):
    return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, 0, len(xs))
```

a. Above is an implementation of the [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm). Draw the recursion graph for `binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))`.

```
binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))

binary_search_array_helper(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14], 0, 9)

binary_search_array_helper(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14], 0, 4)

binary_search_array_helper(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14], 0, 2)

```
b. Is `binary_search_array` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not?

Yes. The algorithm divides the big array and seaches smartly in only parts of the array (i.e. subarray).

c. Is `binary_search_array` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not?

No. It doesn't store values and will recalculate answers instead of remembering it.

d. Consider a memoized version of `binary_binary_search_array_helper`. Draw the recursion graph for a function memoized `memoized_binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))` that calls `memoized_binary_search_array_helper`.

```
First time:

memoized_inary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))

memoized_binary_search_array_helper(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14], 0, 9)

memoized_binary_search_array_helper(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14], 0, 4)

memoized_binary_search_array_helper(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14], 0, 2)

```
For each function call, it will hash the answer returned

e. Under what circumstances does the `memoized_binary_search_array` present any benefits over the unmemoized original? How does this relate to (i) its recursion graph; (ii) the key attributes of a dynamic program?

For each recursive call, we can see in the recursion graph that the `binary_search_array` or `binary_search_array_helper` never gets called with the same values. So the first time you run `memoized_binary_search_array`, it is going to have the same recursion graph. It will hash every value for the function calls made for `memoized_binary_search_array` and `memoized_binary_search_array_helper`. Next time you call any of those funtions with that value, it will use the value stored in the hash.

f. [Optional challenge] Find the bug in `binary_search_array`. What input will cause it to fail? How can this be fixed? (Hint: it is a bug that appears for small arrays. Python is not susceptible to [this bug](https://research.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).)
